# Chess Game README

## Project Description
This repository contains a chess implementation in Python. It allows players to play against each other or against an AI opponent. The AI uses basic minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for move selection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- Pygame-menu library

## Installation
1. Install Python from the official website: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Pygame library using pip:

    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```
3. Install Pygame-menu library using pip:

    ```
    pip install pygame-menu
    ```

## How to Download the Project
You can download the Chess project from the GitHub repository: [Chess GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Misha2007/chess-project)

## How to Run the Game
1. Navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
2. Run the `main.py` file using Python:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

# How to Play Chess

Chess is a classic board game that has been enjoyed for centuries. It's a game of strategy, skill, and anticipation. Here's a brief overview of how to play:

## Objective:
The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. This means putting the opponent's king in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.

## Setup:
1. The chessboard is an 8x8 grid of alternating dark and light squares.
2. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
3. The pieces are set up on the first two rows of the board, with pawns on the second row and other pieces on the first row.

## Movement:
1. Each type of piece moves in a different way:
   - King: Moves one square in any direction.
   - Queen: Moves any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
   - Rook: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
   - Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
   - Knight: Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that.
   - Pawn: Moves forward one square, but captures diagonally.

2. Each player takes turns moving one piece at a time.

## Special Moves:
1. Castling: This move involves moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first rank, then moving the rook to the square over which the king crossed.
2. En Passant: If a pawn moves two squares from its starting position and lands next to an opponent's pawn, the opponent's pawn can capture it as if it had only moved one square.
3. Pawn Promotion: If a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king).

## Check and Checkmate:
1. If a player's king is under attack, it is in check.
2. If a player's king is in check and there is no legal move to remove the threat, it is checkmate, and the game ends with the player who achieved checkmate as the winner.
